  Features:
  - Detect rule type.

  TODOs:
  - Non-flip-symmetric rules
    SUche rules allow 90-deg rotations additionally to 180-deg rotations.
    Rotations are actula for equivalence groups:
    11   10   01
    00 , 00 , 11
    For other groups, rotation is either non-important or equivalent to inverse.
